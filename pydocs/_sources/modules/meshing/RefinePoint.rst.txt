RefinePoint
***********

The RefinePoint class is used to specify locations where you would like more refinement
in your mesh. Create as many refine points as you would like for your mesh and add them
to the :attr:`refine_points <xmsmesh.meshing.MultiPolyMesherIo.refine_points>` list in
your :class:`MultiPolyMesherIo <xmsmesh.meshing.MultiPolyMesherIo>` object.
